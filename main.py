"""
This plugin would ideally be a "dependency", see https://packagecontrol.io/docs/dependencies, but dependencies can't
interface with `sublime_plugin` directly. This means no commands and no event listeners. See
https://github.com/SublimeText/sublime_lib/issues/127#issuecomment-516397027.

This means plugins that "depend" on this one, i.e. that do `from sublime_tree_sitter import get_tree`, need to be loaded
after this one, or they need to do `sublime_tree_sitter` imports after this package has loaded.

It does the following:

- Installs Tree-sitter Python bindings, see https://github.com/tree-sitter/py-tree-sitter
    - Importable by other plugins with `import tree_sitter`
- Installs and builds TS languages, e.g. https://github.com/tree-sitter/tree-sitter-python, based on settings
    - Updates languages on command
- Provides APIs for:
    - Getting a Tree-sitter `Tree` by its buffer id, getting trees for all tracked buffers
    - Subscribing to tree changes in any buffer in real time using `sublime_plugin.EventListener`
    - Passing source code and a scope and getting back a tree
    - Walking a tree, querying a tree, etc

It's easy to build Tree-sitter plugins on top of this one, for "structural" editing, selection, navigation, code
folding, code mapsâ€¦ See e.g. https://zed.dev/blog/syntax-aware-editing for ideas. It's performant and doesn't block the
main thread.

It has the following limitations:

- It doesn't support nested syntax trees, e.g. `<script>` tags in HTML docs
- Due to limitations in Sublime's bundled Python, it requires an external Python 3.8 executable (see settings)
- Due to how syntax highlighting works in Sublime, it can't be used for syntax highlighting
    - See e.g. https://github.com/sublimehq/sublime_text/issues/817
