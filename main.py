"""
This plugin is a "dependency", see https://packagecontrol.io/docs/dependencies.

It does the following:

- Installs and periodically upgrades Tree-sitter Python bindings, see https://github.com/tree-sitter/py-tree-sitter
    - Importable by other plugins with `import tree_sitter`
- Installs and builds TS languages, e.g. https://github.com/tree-sitter/tree-sitter-python, based on settings
    - Updates languages on command
- Provides APIs for:
    - Getting TS tree by its buffer id
    - Subscribing to tree changes in real time using `sublime_plugin.EventListener`
    - Walking a tree, querying a tree, etc

It's easy to build TS plugins on top of this one, for "structural" editing, selection, navigation, code folding, code
mapsâ€¦ See e.g. https://zed.dev/blog/syntax-aware-editing for ideas. It's performant and never blocks the main thread.

It has the following limitations:

- It doesn't support nested syntax trees, e.g. `<script>` tags in HTML docs
- Due to limitations in Sublime's bundled Python, it requires an external Python 3.8 executable (see settings)
- Due to how syntax highlighting works in Sublime, it can't be used for syntax highlighting
    - See e.g. https://github.com/sublimehq/sublime_text/issues/817

        Under the hood, ST synchronously puts any async callbacks onto a queue. It asynchronously handles them in FIFO
        order in a separate thread. Source code suggests this, testing with `time.sleep` confirms it. This ensures
        there are no races between "text change" events (almost always edit) and "load" (always parse).

        We need to know in which buffer text changes occur. All methods in TextChangeListener are tied to the buffer for
        which the listener was instantiated, so this is trivial.

        LRU cache, dict of `(buffer_id, syntax)` tuple keys pointing to dict with tree instance and other metadata.

        When a buffer is loaded, reverted, or reloaded, we do an initial parse to get its tree, and cache that.

        When a text change occurs, we get its buffer, get the buffer's primary view, get its syntax, look up the tree
        and metadata, and update/create the tree as necessary.

        We expose a method to get trees by their buffer, and we returned cached tree or parse on demand if necessary.

        We also expose some convenience methods to walk a tree, etc.
