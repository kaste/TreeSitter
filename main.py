"""
This plugin is a "dependency", see https://packagecontrol.io/docs/dependencies.

It does the following:

- Installs and periodically upgrades Tree-sitter Python bindings, see https://github.com/tree-sitter/py-tree-sitter
    - Importable by other plugins with `import tree_sitter`
- Installs and builds TS languages, e.g. https://github.com/tree-sitter/tree-sitter-python, based on settings
    - Updates languages on command
- Provides APIs for:
    - Getting TS tree by its buffer id
    - Subscribing to tree changes in real time using `sublime_plugin.EventListener`
    - Walking a tree, querying a tree, etc
    - Parsing a string to get a tree, or editing a tree

It's easy to build TS plugins on top of this one, for "structural" editing, selection, navigation, code folding, code
mapsâ€¦ See e.g. https://zed.dev/blog/syntax-aware-editing for ideas. It's performant and doesn't block the main thread.

It has the following limitations:

- It doesn't support nested syntax trees, e.g. `<script>` tags in HTML docs
- Due to limitations in Sublime's bundled Python, it requires an external Python 3.8 executable (see settings)
- Due to how syntax highlighting works in Sublime, it can't be used for syntax highlighting
    - See e.g. https://github.com/sublimehq/sublime_text/issues/817
